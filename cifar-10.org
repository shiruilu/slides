* Introduction
** Where are we so far?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  - Working on different methods to classify hand written digits:
  - What we have tried:
    + LR(ML,MAP), kNN. (A1)
    + MLP. (A2)
    + MoG, PCA. (A3)

** The State-of-the-art

** A real world challenge
[[./images/cifar-10_categories.png]]

  - [[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html][CIFAR-10]] Tiny Images Dataset
    + 60,000 32*32 RGB color images.
    + 10 object classes, 6,000 each.

** A real world challenge (cont'd)
[[./images/cifar-10_categories.png]]

  - [[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html][CIFAR-10]] is tougher.
    + multi-class
    + [[./images/bird7.png]] and [[./images/bird10.png]]
    + [[./images/horse2.png]] and [[./images/horse9.png]]
    + ...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  - Reduce sized [[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html][CIFAR-10]].
    + 6 categories: 0-airplane, 1-automobile, 2-bird, 3-cat, 4-deer, 5-dog.
    + Training: 3000 labeled images (500 each), 31800 unlabeled images.
    + Test: 1200 images.

** Rules
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  - Goal: Maximize accuracy on test set.
  - Restrictions 
    + Any (supervised, unsupervised) model.
    + Any programming language. (Instruct us how to run!)
    + Any publicly available code. (Make sure you tell us!)
    + Work solo, or as a team of 2.

** Submission
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  - A Report (please see a4.pdf for detailed requirements)
  - Code and Data: Specially, include a script like run_prediction.m.
    + Input: an arbitrary size of input test data.
    + Process: Load you trained model, and run on input test set.
    + Output: it's corresponding predictions.
    + Shouldn't take more than 10 mins to run.

** Kaggle (Demo: kNN Baseline)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  - [[https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/tiny-images-classification][Our Competition Home on Kaggle]]
  - [Important] Sign up with you *@hku.hk* email, or you won't get entry to it.
  - Upload your solution (label of the 1,200 test data) as csv format now and then to see how well your model performs.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
#+BEGIN_SRC csv
id,label
1,0
2,0
...
1200,0
#+END_SRC

** Kaggle (cont'd)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  - Kaggle evaluates your solution.csv by comparing it line to line with solutions.csv (ground truth labels of test data) we provided.
  - Performance Measure
    + You resulting accuracy and ranking on leaderboard is shown real-time.
    + But based on 25% of the whole test data, performance on the other 75% is hidden from you.
    + Advice
      + Don't optimize for leaderboard performace, which is likely to overfit the 25% test data. :O
      + At least beat kNN baseline! :D

** Marking Criteria
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  - Resulting Accuracy. (based on Kaggle)
  - Creativity of your idea.
  - Clarity of your report.
    + What makes your result good, and why? and/or,
    + What makes your result unsatisfying, why, and how to improve?
