#Introdution
This repo contains my slides for tutorials (my TA work), class presentations or others,
currently I'm writing [org](http://orgmode.org/) for contents,
and using [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal) to export to [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) to show.

#Usage
To view the slides, please go to http://shiruilu.github.io/slides/[filename].html, replace [filename] with the name of the slides you want to view.
Enjoy :)
